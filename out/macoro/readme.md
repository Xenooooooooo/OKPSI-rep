# Macoro - A C++14/20 coroutine libray

This library is a subset of [cppcoro](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro) with the addition of having c+\+14 support, see the [blog post](https://ladnir.github.io/blog/2022/01/24/macoro.html). 

Currently library contains a general purpose `task<T>, eager_tast<T>` types and various helper algorithms such as `when_all` and cancellations. More to come soon.
